## Research Work
### Multimodal & Information Extraction
- **AFNER: Multimodal Named Entity Recognition on Social Media Platforms**  
  Addresses the poor adaptability of traditional single-modal recognition methods to heterogeneous data (mixed text + multimodal content) on social media; improves the recognition accuracy of named entities in complex scenarios by fusing multimodal features and social media data adaptation strategies.
