## Research Work
### Multimodal Named Entity Recognition & Relation Extraction
- [AFNER](https://github.com/liguochun0304/AFNER): Multimodal Named Entity Recognition on Social Media Platforms [paper 🚧 (TBD)]
  Addresses the poor adaptability of traditional single-modal methods to heterogeneous (text + multimodal) social media data; improves named entity recognition accuracy in complex scenarios via fusing multimodal features and platform-specific adaptation strategies.

- **A Feature-Enhanced Joint Relation Extraction Neural Network Based on State Space Models** [paper 📄](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11085607)
  Proposes a low-resource multimodal information extraction framework that solves the data scarcity problem in specialized domains; achieves efficient feature alignment between text and visual modalities through a lightweight cross-modal attention mechanism.

### Social Media Public Opinion Analysis
- [OctoSmartGraph](https://github.com/liguochun0304/OctoSmartGraph): Knowledge Graph-Driven Social Media Public Opinion Analysis System [paper 🚧 (TBD)]
  Addresses the challenges of scattered public opinion data, ambiguous semantic relevance, and low real-time analysis in social media; constructs a domain-specific knowledge graph for public opinion entities (e.g., events, users, topics) and integrates LLM-based sentiment analysis and event evolution tracking. Supports real-time monitoring of public opinion trends, key node identification, and risk early warning in complex scenarios.
  
### Multimodal Datasets
- [NewsMKG](https://github.com/liguochun0304/NewsMKG): A Benchmark Towards Multimodal Knowledge Graph Extraction [paper 🚧 (TBD)]
  A large-scale multimodal knowledge graph extraction dataset constructed based on real-world news data. Contains over [X] samples covering multiple domains (e.g., politics, economics, technology) with rich multimodal information (text, images, tables). Each sample is annotated with entity types, relation triples, and cross-modal alignment labels, supporting tasks such as multimodal named entity recognition, relation extraction, and knowledge graph construction. Designed to address the lack of high-quality multimodal KG datasets and promote research in cross-modal knowledge extraction.

## Open Source Projects
### Technical Tools & Frameworks (System-Level)
- [docker-quick-reference](https://github.com/liguochun0304/docker-quick-reference): Docker Practical Guide & Cheat Sheet 📚
  A concise and practical Docker reference document designed for developers and researchers. Covers core concepts, common commands, container orchestration, image building, and troubleshooting solutions. Features quick search, example-driven explanations, and scenario-based configuration templates to help users quickly master Docker for project deployment and environment management.

- [flask-mcp-demo](https://github.com/liguochun0304/flask-mcp-demo): FastAPI-based Large Language Model Service & MCP Implementation 🚀 [🚧 In Progress]
  A high-performance asynchronous backend service framework built with FastAPI for service-oriented encapsulation of Large Language Model (LLM) capabilities. Implements standardized LLM inference interfaces (dialogue interaction, text generation, streaming response, batch reasoning) and a complete **Model Control Plane (MCP)** service demo with core modules: model registration, dynamic scheduling, version governance, load balancing and inference resource management. The lightweight modular architecture supports seamless integration with mainstream LLMs, and is optimized for rapid engineering deployment of LLM-powered academic research tasks (knowledge graph extraction, multimodal information mining, social media public opinion analysis). Integrated with native FastAPI features: strict data validation, auto-generated interactive API docs, and extensible middleware, serving as a production-ready prototype for building industrial-grade LLM application services.
