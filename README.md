## Research Work
### Multimodal & Information Extraction
- **AFNER: Multimodal Named Entity Recognition on Social Media Platforms**
  Addresses the poor adaptability of traditional single-modal methods to heterogeneous (text + multimodal) social media data; improves named entity recognition accuracy in complex scenarios via fusing multimodal features and platform-specific adaptation strategies.
