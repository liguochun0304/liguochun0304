## Research Work
### Multimodal Named Entity Recognition & Relation Extraction
- [AFNER](https://github.com/liguochun0304/AFNER): Multimodal Named Entity Recognition on Social Media Platforms [paper 🚧 (TBD)]
  Addresses the poor adaptability of traditional single-modal methods to heterogeneous (text + multimodal) social media data; improves named entity recognition accuracy in complex scenarios via fusing multimodal features and platform-specific adaptation strategies.

- **A Feature-Enhanced Joint Relation Extraction Neural Network Based on State Space Models** [paper 📄](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11085607)
  Proposes a low-resource multimodal information extraction framework that solves the data scarcity problem in specialized domains; achieves efficient feature alignment between text and visual modalities through a lightweight cross-modal attention mechanism.

### Social Media Public Opinion Analysis
- [OctoSmartGraph](https://github.com/liguochun0304/OctoSmartGraph): Knowledge Graph-Driven Social Media Public Opinion Analysis System [paper 🚧 (TBD)]
  Addresses the challenges of scattered public opinion data, ambiguous semantic relevance, and low real-time analysis in social media; constructs a domain-specific knowledge graph for public opinion entities (e.g., events, users, topics) and integrates LLM-based sentiment analysis and event evolution tracking. Supports real-time monitoring of public opinion trends, key node identification, and risk early warning in complex scenarios.
