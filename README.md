## Research Work
### Multimodal Named Entity Recognition & Relation Extraction
- [AFNER](https://github.com/liguochun0304/AFNER): Multimodal Named Entity Recognition on Social Media Platforms [paper 🚧 (TBD)]
  Focus on heterogeneous text-image social media data; adopt **BERT** (text) + **CLIP** (image) encoding, **BiLSTM** modeling, and text-image similarity based auxiliary loss to enhance cross-modal alignment for multimodal NER.
  
- **A Feature-Enhanced Joint Relation Extraction Neural Network Based on State Space Models** [paper 📄](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11085607)
  Addresses multi-relational triplet extraction, long-distance dependencies, and similar relation challenges in joint entity-relation extraction. Integrates **Mamba2** module + parallel multi-head attention for semantic capture, with a feature enhancement module to mitigate data scarcity and fine-grained redundancy. Achieves SOTA performance on HacRED dataset (F1=64.5) for multi-relational extraction tasks.
  
### Social Media Public Opinion Analysis
- [OctoSmartGraph](https://github.com/liguochun0304/OctoSmartGraph): Knowledge Graph-Driven Social Media Public Opinion Analysis System [paper 🚧 (TBD)]
  Based on **LLM** and **Multi-Agent** framework, constructs knowledge graphs for social media hot topics, and completes analysis of hot events to generate structured event analysis reports.
  
### Multimodal Datasets
- [NewsMKG](https://github.com/liguochun0304/NewsMKG): A Benchmark Towards Multimodal Knowledge Graph Extraction [paper 🚧 (TBD)]
  A large-scale multimodal KG extraction dataset built from real-world news via **data collection → LLM-based pre-annotation → manual verification**. Covers politics, economics, technology, etc., with text/images/tables; annotated with entities, relation triples, and cross-modal alignment labels, supporting multimodal NER, relation extraction, and KG construction. Addresses the scarcity of high-quality multimodal KG datasets.
