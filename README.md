## Research Work
### Multimodal Named Entity Recognition & Relation Extraction
- [AFNER](https://github.com/liguochun0304/AFNER): Multimodal Named Entity Recognition on Social Media Platforms [paper 🚧 (TBD)]
  Focus on heterogeneous text-image social media data; adopt **BERT** (text) + **CLIP** (image) encoding, **BiLSTM** modeling, and text-image similarity based auxiliary loss to enhance cross-modal alignment for multimodal NER.
  
- **A Feature-Enhanced Joint Relation Extraction Neural Network Based on State Space Models** [paper 📄](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11085607)
  Addresses multi-relational triplet extraction, long-distance dependencies, and similar relation challenges in joint entity-relation extraction. Integrates **Mamba2** module + parallel multi-head attention for semantic capture, with a feature enhancement module to mitigate data scarcity and fine-grained redundancy. Achieves SOTA performance on HacRED dataset (F1=64.5) for multi-relational extraction tasks.
  
### Social Media Public Opinion Analysis
- [OctoSmartGraph](https://github.com/liguochun0304/OctoSmartGraph): Knowledge Graph-Driven Social Media Public Opinion Analysis System [paper 🚧 (TBD)]
  Based on **LLM** and **Multi-Agent** framework, constructs knowledge graphs for social media hot topics, and completes analysis of hot events to generate structured event analysis reports.
  
### Multimodal Datasets
- [NewsMKG](https://github.com/liguochun0304/NewsMKG): A Benchmark Towards Multimodal Knowledge Graph Extraction [paper 🚧 (TBD)]
  A large-scale multimodal KG extraction dataset built from real-world news via **data collection → LLM-based pre-annotation → manual verification**. Covers politics, economics, technology, etc., with text/images/tables; annotated with entities, relation triples, and cross-modal alignment labels, supporting multimodal NER, relation extraction, and KG construction. Addresses the scarcity of high-quality multimodal KG datasets.

## Open Source Projects
### Technical Tools & Frameworks (System-Level)
- [docker-quick-reference](https://github.com/liguochun0304/docker-quick-reference): Docker Practical Guide & Cheat Sheet 📚
  A concise basic operation guide tailored for Docker beginners in laboratories. Covers core concepts, common commands, image building, basic configuration templates, and common troubleshooting. Features example-driven explanations for quick上手 (quick start) in project deployment and environment management without in-depth learning.

- [flask-mcp-demo](https://github.com/liguochun0304/flask-mcp-demo): FastAPI-based Large Language Model Service & MCP Implementation 🚀 [🚧 In Progress]
  A high-performance asynchronous backend service framework built with FastAPI for service-oriented encapsulation of Large Language Model (LLM) capabilities. Implements standardized LLM inference interfaces (dialogue interaction, text generation, streaming response, batch reasoning) and a complete **Model Control Plane (MCP)** service demo with core modules: model registration, dynamic scheduling, version governance, load balancing and inference resource management. The lightweight modular architecture supports seamless integration with mainstream LLMs, and is optimized for rapid engineering deployment of LLM-powered academic research tasks (knowledge graph extraction, multimodal information mining, social media public opinion analysis). Integrated with native FastAPI features: strict data validation, auto-generated interactive API docs, and extensible middleware, serving as a production-ready prototype for building industrial-grade LLM application services.
